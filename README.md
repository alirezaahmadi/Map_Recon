# Map-Recon (A pure c++ and ROS implementation of 3D point-cloud registration with ICP (featured base initial guess))

We present the results of our study on how depth and RGB images from a RGB-D sensor can be used to build a dense 3D map of the indoor environment using different variants of Iterative Closet Point (ICP) approach. Such dense 3D map can be used in robot navigation and environment segmentation applications. The method incorporated in this paper uses descriptor based features extracted from RGB and depth images as correspondence used in the registration process. Also, the result of a point-to-point registration using the Nearest Neighbor (NN) search approach is compared with other variants too. As all the requirements and implementation are quite similar to Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem, there have been some efforts to detect the loop closures, followed by pose graph optimization to achieve a globally consistent map. Our implementation is based on C++ under ROS platform. The evaluation of 3D point-cloud registration using a RGB-D camera dataset along the ICP method illuminates the efficiency of descriptor-based matching in contrast with simple NN search approach for more complicated models or with more strange misalignments which all the result are explained in details under evaluation section.
